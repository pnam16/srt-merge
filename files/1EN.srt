Star light, star bright,

first star I see tonight,

have this wish I wish tonight.

10
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:38,270
Once upon a time,

11
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:41,066
a Wishing Star
fell from the sky.

12
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:47,314
Scorching a great woods black.

13
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:51,766
The Dark Forest was born,

14
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:54,528
the Wishing Star hidden
at its center,

15
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,600
filling it with new life,

16
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:02,156
and the legend of a single wish
locked away in the star,

17
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:05,194
waiting to be granted.

00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,652
